Currently, depending on my desire and mood, I perform tasks on Exercism that help me learn the purely functional language of Elm. To be honest, most of the code isn't mine. I rewrite, read and model solutions from other users of the Exercism platform. I'm also using GPT4 in Microsoft Copilot. It helps a lot to solve exercises and explain concepts that I don't understand. I started learning Elm to learn functional programming. Elm is the simplest functional language. However, most of the concepts are unclear to me.
